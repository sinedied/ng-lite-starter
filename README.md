# ðŸª¶ ng-lite starter

> Minimal starter for Angular projects.

See this [dev.to article](WIP) to see how this starter was created and for more details about the differences with Angular CLI's default `ng new`.

## Usage

To create a new project from this starter, you can either:

- Run `npx degit sinedied/ng-lite-starter <project-name>`
- Or select **Use this template** button at the top of this repository and follow the instructions.

## Tasks

This starter is used the same way as any Angular project, ie using the included NPM scripts or the Angular CLI directly:

- `ng serve`: run dev server at `http://localhost:4200/`
- `ng build`: build the project in the `dist/` directory.
- `ng generate component component-name`: generates a new component.

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
